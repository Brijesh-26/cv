        <li>In Spring 2022, Karen Levy and I are teaching Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340).
            The course is designed at an introductory level with no<br>
            formal prerequisites, and covers a range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and
            information.</li>

        <li>D. Easley, J. Kleinberg. Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World. Cambridge
            University Press, 2010.

                    This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled Networks. The book, like
                    the
                    course, is designed at the introductory undergraduate level with no<br> formal prerequisites. To
                    support
                    deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with optional advanced sections.
